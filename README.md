### General Goal
To the best of ability, all samples will follow this simple format where n is 100. 
```
for i = 1 to n do
    if i is divisible by 3 and i is divisible by 5 then
        print "FizzBuzz"
    else if i is divisible by 3 then
        print "Fizz"
    else if i is divisible by 5 then
        print "Buzz"
    else
        print i
```
